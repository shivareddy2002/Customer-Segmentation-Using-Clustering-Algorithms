Project: Customer Segmentation Using Clustering Algorithms
Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic information, helping businesses tailor their marketing strategies, improve customer experiences, and optimize sales efforts.

Problem Statement:
Businesses often have diverse customer bases with varying preferences and spending patterns. Without effective segmentation, it becomes challenging to target customers with personalized marketing campaigns. This project aims to categorize customers into distinct groups to better understand their behavior and preferences.

Project Approach:
Data Collection:
A retail dataset containing customer information, purchasing history, and behavioral data was used.

Data Preprocessing:

Data cleaning (handling missing values, outliers, and duplicates).
Standardization and normalization of features for clustering.
Feature selection based on relevant variables like spending patterns and visit frequency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analysis of customer demographics and purchasing trends.
Visualization of key patterns and correlations to understand the distribution of features.
Clustering Algorithms:

K-Means Clustering: Identified optimal clusters using the elbow method.
Segmented customers into distinct groups based on purchasing and behavioral features.
Model Evaluation:

Used silhouette scores to evaluate cluster cohesion and separation.
Validated clusters through visualizations like scatter plots and cluster heatmaps.
Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Tools: Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization
Key Results:
Successfully identified distinct customer segments with unique behavioral characteristics.
Segmentation insights included:
High-spending loyal customers.
Price-sensitive occasional buyers.
Frequent low-value purchasers.
Visualized clusters with meaningful patterns to aid business decisions.
